## Setup

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Action requires Node.js and >4.1.1 (we're using 5.10.0 in development).
[Go here](https://nodejs.org/) to install a version for your system.
If you already have node, we recommend [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage your node versions.

Action also depends on [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/). Make sure you have it installed.
If you have OSX, we recommend homebrew so upgrades are as easy as `brew update && brew upgrade rethinkdb`

#### Source code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ParabolInc/action.git
$ cd action
$ rethinkdb # in a separate window
$ npm install
$ npm run quickstart
```
_Remember: if RethinkDB is running locally, you can reach its dashboard at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default._

### Client-side development

In this mode, webpack will hot swap your updated client modules without restarting the server.
```bash
$ npm start
```
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Server-side development

In this mode, the server will use your pre-built client bundle & only restart the server with fresh code.
```bash
$ npm run bs
```
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Database development
- All tables are managed in `./src/server/setupDB.js`. Just add your tables & indices to that file and rerun
- http://localhost:3000/graphql for testing out new queries/mutations
